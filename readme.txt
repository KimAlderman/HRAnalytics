I am including the data file, HRdata.csv, as part of this zip file. If needed, the original data file can be obtained from Kaggle via the following URL:
https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics/downloads/HR_comma_sep.csv
To run the Jupyter notebook with Python code, please rename the file to HRdata.csv

The Jupyter notebook uses Python 2.7 code. The following libraries are used in the project:
* sklearn
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
Please be sure these are installed before running the Jupyter notebook.
