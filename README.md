# HRAnalytics
Capstone project for Udacity Machine Learning nanodegree

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that identifys the high-performing employees that are most likely to leave so that human resources can intervene to possibly retain them, thereby reducing turnover of these high-value employees.

Tools and techniques used in this project include:

* data exploration through summary statistics and data visualization
* pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib libraries for Python
* converting categorical features to dummy variables using pandas get_dummies function
* splitting data into train & test sets, shuffling, and cross-validation
* evaluating pros & cons of different supervised machine learning models and choosing appropriate models for this application
* performance metrics for unbalanced classes, including precision, recall, and F1 score; used equal-weight F1 score for this project
* sklearn implementation of 3 models for comparison: logistic regression, random forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM)
* use of RandomizedSearch for random forest hyperparameter tuning and optimization

Please read the Capstone Report and iPython notebook for further details regarding implementation and analysis of this project.
